## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze thyroid differentiation data to understand various aspects of thyroid function, risk factors, and treatment outcomes. The analysis includes data aggregation, filtering, risk factor analysis, predictive modeling, stage and risk analysis, and outcome assessment.

## Data Description
The data is stored in a table named `Thyroid_Diff` with columns including:
- Thyroid Function
- Risk
- Smoking
- Recurred
- Age
- Gender
- Pathology
- Focality
- Response
- Stage
- Physical_Examination

## Queries
The project includes several SQL queries categorized as follows:

1. Data Aggregation and Filtering
2. Risk Factor Analysis
3. Predictive Modeling
4. Stage and Risk Analysis
5. Outcome Assessment

Each category contains multiple queries designed to extract specific insights from the data.
